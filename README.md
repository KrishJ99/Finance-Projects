# Finance

This is my Finance repository. This repository serves as a dedicated space for all my finance-related Python projects. Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of notebooks, and resources focused on various aspects of financial analysis, options analysis, portfolio optimization, risk management, algorithmic trading and data-driven investment strategies.


The primary aim of this repository is to document and share my journey in applying Python to solve complex problems in finance.
